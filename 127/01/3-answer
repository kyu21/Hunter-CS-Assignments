This program prints out factors of 12 starting with 2 and not including 12. First the program checks if i is less then 12 and if it is, it checks if 12 mod i is 0 or if i divides evenly into 12. If i is a factor, i gets printed and then regardless if anything gets printed, i gets incremented. Finally the program checks again if i is less than 12 and continues the while loop until i is equal to or greater than 12.
