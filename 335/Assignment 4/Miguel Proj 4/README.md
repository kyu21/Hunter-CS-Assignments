## Introduction
The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with the concepts of graphs as well as graphing algorithms such as topological sort or Dijkstras algorithm and implement them within a program.

first make with 

```
make all
```

then run with 

## Part A
**Input**
```
./CreateGraphAndTest <GRAPH_FILE> <ADJ_QUERY_FILE>
```

## Part B Dijkstra
**Input**
```
./FindPaths <GRAPH_FILE> <VERTEX_NUM>
```

## Part C Topological Sort
**Input**
```
./TopologicalSort <GRAPH_FILE> 
```
